  Hi there,
</h2>
<p>
  this is a <em>basic</em> example of <strong>tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you’d probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    That’s a bullet list with one …
  </li>
  <li>
    … or two list items.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The Link extension adds support for <a href="https://tiptap.dev/api/marks/link"> tags to the editor </a>. The extension is headless too, there is no actual UI to add, modify or delete links. The usage example below uses the native JavaScript prompt to show you how that could work.
</p>
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" />
<p>
  Isn’t that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there’s more. Let’s try a code block:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
display: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>
  I know, I know, this is impressive. It’s only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don’t forget to check the other examples too.
